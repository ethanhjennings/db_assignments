# Database Assignments
Lessons and assignments introducing databases with Python and SQL.

## Setup
In your terminal clone this repository with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethanhjennings/db_assignments
```
Now the `db_assignments` directory will contain all the lessons/assignments and code.

## File Structure
Each subdirectory in this repository contiains the project instructions stored in a `README.md` file and accompanying `lesson.md` file with the lesson. (You're actually viewing the `README.md` for the entire repository right now). These files are written in *Markdown*, a markup language with source code that looks like a normal README text file. Github automatically formats and displays them, but you can also read them offline in your editor as plain text files if you prefer.

## Getting started
The first project is `warmup`. If you're viewing this on github.com click on the `warmup` directory above to see the lesson.
